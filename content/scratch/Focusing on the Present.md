title: Focusing on the Present

This phrase is commonly echoed by self-enrichment books, life gurus, and both wise and unwise friends alike. Semantically, it's easy to grasp. Yet, the challenge lies in its application. Perhaps its simplicity is precisely what makes it difficult, as we often overlook the obvious.

We should acknowledge that life is a journey, and we are its transient travelers. It's imperative, then, to live fully.

This journey encompasses memories of past joys and sorrows, along with concerns for an unpredictable future that many spend considerable time planning and preparing for.


However, consider this viewpoint: 

If we are overly preoccupied with the past and future, we might neglect the simple moments in the present. The smile of a cat strolling by, the colors of cars passing outside your window, the taste of the Bento you're currently enjoying â€“ these are the realities of life in the present. "Do you remember the taste of your last meal?" By constantly overlooking the present, we aren't truly living the life given to us.

This concept, as elaborated by [[Jay Shetty]] in his book, "_8 Rules of Love: How to Find it, Keep it, and Let it Go_", helped me understand the importance of "focusing on the present."

Does this mean we should ignore past lessons or future preparations? I don't have a definitive answer. I believe that reflecting on the past crystallizes lessons that guide our present decisions. Focusing on what feels right in the moment is, in my opinion, the best way to prepare for a future beyond our control.
