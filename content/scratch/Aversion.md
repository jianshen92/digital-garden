title: Aversion to Change

We are all subject, and the same time, the victim to our own ego. Humans are change-averse, no matter you admit it or not. 

I have came to realise that, it is a lonely path to walk, if you want to do things differently, like truly different from the norm. At first, people hype you up because everyone loves the adrenaline from the thoughts of new change. But once adversity strikes, their faith falls one by one, like bowling pins hit by a ball. Even your closest ones, or at least you thought they were close enough to believe in you till the end.

It will not be long until you doubt yourself, because no one else are believing anymore. Until they concretely feel the results of the change. 

The level of self-believe for those who managed to defy odds, are extremely high, and extremely respectable.

I walked through that path briefly, and believe me, it is tough as mountain of rocks.

Innovations, are not advisable, if you treasure your lifespan (:
