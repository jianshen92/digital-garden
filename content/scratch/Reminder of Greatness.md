**"Great minds discuss ideas; average minds discuss events; small minds discuss people."** - _Eleanor Roosevelt_

Gossiping is a cheap way to obtain a dopamine hit; it's tempting to speak about someone who isn't present. Engaging in it offers little to no long-term benefits.

I view discussing ideas as a form of [[Delayed Gratification]]. Ideas require iterations and challenges to become clear and mature. In this era of a social media surge and information glut, our minds are becoming accustomed to the quick reward cycle.

I don't claim to belong to the "Great Minds" category, but I present this as a vivid reminder: every moment spent on gossip is a missed opportunity to engage in something more meaningful.
