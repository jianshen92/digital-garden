title: Vertical Stack
---

This is the strategy that is used across all levels at ultimate, especially at the beginner and the highest level (USA ultimate in particular). 

It is very interesting to see that, because most teams deviates from using vertical stack as they get more competitive, as we see across EU and AU. And with the recent popularity of Hex Offense, we see even less use of the vertical stack.

Why do most beginners are taught vertical stack as their first type of offense structure? (speaking based on my experience in Malaysia)
One hypothesis that I have, is that it's a simple structure with straight forward instructions. The typical instructions to tell a beginner is that,
* always cut from the back (of front)
* if you don't get the disc, go back to the stack and wait for your turn.

Logistically it make sense, because you don't want to overwhelm a beginner with many complicated instructions and what-ifs.

It also allows the handler, which is typically the best player among the beginners, to have plenty of space to run and retrieve the disc from a less experienced player. This is untold, but true. Vertical stack, in my opinion, is a **handler dominant** structure.

However, as the team progress to becomes more matured and experienced, they begin to fail with this simple structure. Because the movements of a vertical stack is very predictable, elite teams are able to anticipate the next move and tailor their defense to stop it. Like [Flex Defense](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdUbFaUZpsU). 

So what are the **obvious flaws** of vertical stack:
* Movements are very predictable
* Many inactive players (usually the middle of stack), defense to poach and make plays to overload the active area
* The spaces are split into a clear division of open and break, losing the middle space, because that's where the stack resides

Now another question arises, if vertical stack is flawed, why does USA repetitively find success with it?

It's hard to tell, but let's list down the possibility.

1. The USA athletes are just, better. Faster, taller, and throws better than everyone else. 

If that is the case, they should probably do as well with any type of structure. 

2. The Vertical Stack, is a structure that plays best by team that is similar to USA's physique.

This could be true, but we see that Canada does not share the similar success as USA, at least in the recent year. In that case, I would be more incline to believe that USA just has better athlete overall.

3. Maybe, the stack is just a superior strategy overall. Just that the USA is doing something differently as compared to the rest of the world.

And this argument is interesting. Comparing it with middle level plays, some observations that I found are:
* The structure of the stack is only visible upon a dead disc. This creates clear 1v1 for handler to start to flow. The USA athlete has exceptionally great skill to would always win a 1v1.
* Players doesn't just "go back into the stack". Once the disc gets into flow, we often see players are very spread out, similar to how a Hex Offense positions their player.
* USA cycles through the stack, way faster than any other countries. e.g. they take 3 seconds to cycle through from 1st to 3rd in the stack, as compared to maybe 5 seconds for others. This relates to the athletic abilities of the player.

My personal take on this, is it is very likely that the USA players are just more skillful and they will do well regardless of the strategy that they play. However, at the same time, some of the principles that are taught at beginner to mid level, is different from the high level. At the high level we often see player "violates" the rule of a vertical, as mentioned above. Which leads me to believe, every structure in ultimate at it finest form, closely resembles each other. 

Ultimate in "Flow", looks very alike regardless of the initial structure, and I think they adhere to a certain set of organic principles -- which are yet to be formulated, and that is the goal, of this project.
