Over the years of playing the sport, I have changed my thoughts on multiple times on how could we better play it, tactically.

But yet, the more I know, the more I feel I don't know enough. There is a hunch, that there's a higher level abstraction that is yet to be unfold. I will not rush through the process in trying to formulate **The Theory of Everything** for Ultimate Frisbee, and I would rather, jot down notes and ideas whenever I come across it. And hopefully over time, the "framework" would complete by itself, just like how science evolves over by continuous experiments and invalidating the past theorems.
