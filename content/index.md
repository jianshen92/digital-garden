Yello, I'm Jian Shen.

Or some may call me, JS. That's how the name of this digital garden is pronounced. jaye-es.

This is probably my 99th attempt, in setting up an online writing space for myself. And hopefully this one will last.

I want to use this space to scribble my thoughts, and hopefully over time, the abstractions of **what is the meaning of life**, will slowly crystallized. Analogous to how life itself, is formed.


The garden is divided into few sections:
* [The F Project](/ultimate) - (Pending a better name) My dedication to find a good abstraction to the tactics of the sports that I have been playing for 15 years -- Ultimate Frisbee
* [The Blog](/blog) - Delicately crafted passages with distinct messages to deliver, ~possibly~ ~most likely~ grammatically corrected by LLMs
* [The Scratch Pad](/scratch) - Random thoughts or ideas that flow across the ether.
