# Prelude

Throughout my career and life journey, I've been immensely fortunate to receive support from various individuals. In the context of this blog, it will be about software engineering and AI. The ability to create and build is life-changing, and I'm eager to share these experiences with the world, in my own way.

# What is This About?

I'm seeking passionate individuals who aspire to enter the fields of software engineering or AI but lack the know-how or opportunity to do so. I propose a collaborative project, drawing from my personal experiences and challenges faced over the years. The learning approach is top-down: **Learn What Matters**, **Build Something You Desire**, and **Enjoy the Thrill of Exploration**.

This opportunity is ideal for:

- Students or recent graduates with non-CS/AI degrees aiming to enter this field.
- Working professionals considering a career switch.
- Software engineers curious about AI.
- Those looking to transition from AI to software engineering.
- .. Or just anyone with a love for exploration and learning

We'll work together to build a project at your pace, ideally within three months, with a commitment of a several hours each week for your own work and weekly discussions.

The goal is to equip you with the tools for self-sufficiency in your ongoing journey.

Interested? Please reach out for a conversation! Currently, I can take on **one or at most two** projects at a time.

## But.. What's the Catch?

None. It's completely free. This initiative is driven purely by your passion, and that fuels mine.

My only desire? Is that you'll be able to echo this gift passed to you today, to someone else someday.

## So.. Who Am I?

I'm someone who has worked in the tech space and is forever thankful for those who aided my journey without expecting anything in return.
